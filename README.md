# Crux

A tiny language for algorithmic music. Build phrases ("mots") from relative pitch/time events ("pips"), then transform and combine them with a small, composable operator set.

- Relative pitch (step) and duration (timeScale)
- Two mapping semantics for binary ops: **fan** (spread) and **cog** (tile)
- Concise sequencing: concatenation, postfix repeat and underscore slicing
- Musical transforms: steps, mirror, lens, tie, constraint, jam, rotate, Glass, Reich, PÃ¤rt

# Install
